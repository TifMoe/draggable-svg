# Polar and Rhino

Serverless [React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) deployed to the web using [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). This is my first time using [Greensock's animation library](https://greensock.com/draggable/) to make custom SVG elements draggable. 

Most critically, it's a fun little site to build with my neice and nephew who are interested in learning to code - featuring their favorite animals!

You can check out this very important website [here](https://polarvsrhino.win/).
